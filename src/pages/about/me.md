## Working Life/Hiatus
In 2024 and prior, I had a 9-to-5 job, but when I came home, I didn't have the mental capacity to handle anything else besides the chores I needed to do at that moment. My personal to-do list had grown so long that I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt, making it impossible to enjoy my day-to-day life. These obligations included managing my parents' retirement finances, figuring out a healthy setup/routine for one of our black cats that lost the ability to use her hind legs, managing my weight/exercise, and 100s of little things that needed done or maintained around the house.

So that year, I decided to take a hiatus. I had been hoarding loot and been stingy about its usage for about 2 decades, so I had enough savings to take a break for at least a year without it breaking the bank. My wife still had a job so health insurance wasn't a huge issue.

## Budgeting, Finances & More

Since then, I've learned a lot about social security, taxes, estate planning, and various retirement products, while managing my parents' finances. I've also been working on reducing my expenses and increasing investment income since ultimately my earned income was a staggering <b>zero dollars a month</b>.

Our 15-year old black cat, Zoey, who we didn't think would last the year 2024, has been happy and healthy as you can see below.

## Why I Started This Site
My primary intention was to get back into programming. I haven't done heavy front-end development in about a decade.

Once I decided on doing a blog of some sort, if I had to choose a topic that I had a large amount of knowledge or expertise about, it would be finding amazing deals and using various financial products/apps. I try very hard to never buy anything at full price. Hopefully, readers can gain from my insights to save some money in their own lives.

The only way this site earns money is through the affiliate links I include in my posts. I would be grateful if you'd use them, but it's not required. Referrals from friends and family are other ways to save money within your circle, so it makes sense to use their referrals. But you can rest assured that I'll never let a potential referral influence my honest opinion.
